# Flox Build Environment for ComfyUI Add-ons
# ===========================================
# This environment builds Python packages for ComfyUI that need to work
# with CUDA-enabled PyTorch. The key insight is that we DON'T include
# torch/torchvision as build dependencies - they're provided by the
# runtime environment (comfyui-repo).
#
# Nix expression builds are in .flox/pkgs/:
#   - comfyui-ultralytics.nix
#
# Usage:
#   flox build                    # Build all packages
#   flox build comfyui-ultralytics # Build specific package
#
# The built packages can then be referenced in comfyui-repo via store-path.
